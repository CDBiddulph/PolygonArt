# PolygonArt

Through multiple stages, this program converts images into "polygon art." The algorithm chooses a set of triangles that exactly covers the area of the image and the colors of the pixels within each triangle are averaged to create an angular, geometric effect. The triangles are chosen to minimize "color variance," which results in fewer jagged edges near the borders of objects in the picture.
